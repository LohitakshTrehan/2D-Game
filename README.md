#2D Game using pure JS and HTML5 < canvas > 

Starting with pure JS is the best way to get a solid knowledge about web game development.<br/>
After that you can pick any of the frameworks you like and use it in your projects.

Even the knowledge on how the framework works is important as you are going to use them.<br/>
What if someone has done some malicious activity in the framework's code :P poor joke! <br/>

All i want is to understand that even how the frameworks work!

It will be a simple game where user has to break the bars using a ball and the ball should land on the moving platform otherwise you loose a life, 
a simple 90's game we used to play.
